# 7DtD-Placeable-Mech-Protector
A Mech Robot that you can craft and place to defend your base for 7 Days to Die. 

Created for A18(B4). 

Hard dependency is 0-CreaturePackMechs - https://github.com/7D2D/A18Mods/
as it links to the models and sounds from that mod.

Uses the model for the miniBike for now because using the mech's own model will not allow it to be placed on the ground for some reason.
